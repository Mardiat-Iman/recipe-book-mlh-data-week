I attended the Major League Hacking, Global Hack Week, where I started this project at one of their workshops/streams.
I have since then updated it and added more features, tailoring it to what I want it to look like.
(Updates are still ongoing)

I built a recipe book using Streamlit, an open-source Python library that makes it easy to share and build custom web apps for machine learning, data science, and more!

This included:
- Use of Streamlit to host the app
- Used MongoDB to set up my cluster
- Used Streamlit  basics to add widgets
- Configured several pages to navigate
- Created personalized queries for a search bar
- Created a generator to give users recipes based on available ingredients
- Currently: implementing a vector database and semantic search

Note: This project is still being currently updated and refined
