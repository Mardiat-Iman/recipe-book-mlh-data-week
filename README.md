I attended the Major League Hacking, Global Hack Week, where I started this project at one of their workshops/streams.
Since then, I have updated it and added more features, tailoring it to what I want it to look like.


I built a recipe book using Streamlit, an open-source Python library that makes it easy to share and build custom web apps for machine learning, data science, and more!

This included:
- Use of Streamlit to host my app
- Used MongoDB to set up my cluster to store recipes
- Used Streamlit  basics to add widgets
- Configured several pages to navigate
- Created personalized queries for a search bar
- Created a recipe generator using prompt engineering

Note: This project is still being currently updated and refined

Future Implementation:
- Deletion of recipes from the user's end.
- Statistic and summray preview cards.
