I attended the Major League Hacking, Global Hack Week , where I started this project at one onf their workshops/streams.
I have since then updated it and added more features, talioring it to what I want it to look like.
(Updates are still ungoing)

I built a recipebook using Streamlit, an open-source Python library that makes it easy to share and build custom web apps for machine learning, data science, and more!

This included:
- Use of Streamlit to host your app
- Used MongoDB to set up my cluster
- Used Streamlit  basics to add widgets
- Configured several pages to navigate
- Created personalized queries for a search bar
- Posted documents to MongoDB
- Created a simple chat bot using OpenAI

Note: This porject is still being currently updated and refined
